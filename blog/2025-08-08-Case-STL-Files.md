Here are the STL Files for printing the case. You should be able to print without supports.

## Case Preview

The case requires 3 M2.5x35mm long bolts to assemble. 

To attach the case to your robot, there are two options:
- Holes in the side wings
- Zip tie slots across the top


Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback regarding the design.

# Why Train Your Own Models?

Using pre-trained AI models might seem convenient, but training custom models gives your FIRST team a competitive edge. There is also a strong educational benefit: you learn by doing. Collecting data, labeling images, and iterating on your model builds real understanding of how computer vision and machine learning work—skills that go beyond the competition.

## The Problem with Generic Models

Every robot is unique. A model trained on someone else's robot won't work optimally on yours because:

### Camera Differences
- **Mounting Position**: Your camera's height and angle are unique—the viewing angle directly affects model accuracy, so training on your robot's perspective matters.
- **Lens Characteristics**: Each camera sees the world slightly differently

### Performance Benefits
- **Fewer False Positives**: Waste less autonomous time on incorrect detections
- **Faster Inference**: Optimized for exactly what you need to detect
- **Tunable Confidence**: Adjust thresholds for your strategy

### Optional: Lighting Calibration

:::tip Advanced Technique
While you *can* capture training images in specific competition venue which can help with variations in backgrounds, carpet colors, and lighting  **this is usually overkill**. YOLO-Pro handles typical lighting variations well. Focus on diverse angles and distances instead—only worry about lighting if you're experiencing actual detection failures.

## The Bottom Line

**Your robot → Your camera → Your model**

Custom training means your robot sees the world the way it actually experiences it. This is what separates good vision systems from great ones.

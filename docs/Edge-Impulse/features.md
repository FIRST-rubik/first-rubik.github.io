# Edge Impulse Features

[Edge Impulse](https://firstrobotics.edgeimpulse.com/) provides FIRST teams with powerful tools to streamline AI development—no PhD required.

## AI-Assisted Labeling

Labeling hundreds of images is tedious. Edge Impulse speeds this up significantly.

### Key Features
- **Auto-Labeling**: Pre-trained models suggest bounding boxes automatically
- **Smart Suggestions**: After 20-30 manual labels, the system learns your patterns
- **Batch Operations**: Copy labels across similar images with keyboard shortcuts
- **Labeling Queue**: Organized workflow tracks progress and ensures nothing is missed

:::tip Time Saver
Label 20-30 images manually, then let AI assist with the rest. Review and correct suggestions—saves hours of work!

## Model Optimization

Edge Impulse automatically optimizes models for your Rubik Pi and is automatically supported on PhotonVision (no extra steps required)

### Quantization (INT8)
- **4x Smaller**: Reduced file size for faster loading
- **Faster Inference**: Integer math is faster than floating-point
- **Minimal Accuracy Loss**: Typically &lt;1-2% reduction

### Hardware Optimization
- Automatically optimized for RUBIK Pi 3
- Takes advantage of NPU acceleration
- No manual tuning required

## Version Control

Track and compare model versions:
- **Change History**: What changed between versions
- **Performance Comparison**: Side-by-side metrics
- **Rollback**: Revert to previous versions if needed
- **Progress Tracking**: See improvement over time

# Flashing Ubuntu

1. [Flash The Device](https://www.thundercomm.com/rubik-pi-3/en/docs/rubik-pi-3-user-manual/1.0.0-u/Update-Software/3.2.Flash-using-Qualcomm-Launcher)

:::note
Don't configure the device, it's not needed as Photonvision will take care of everything
:::

2. Instead of selecting Ubuntu in the Qualcomm Launcher, please select Custom and grab the latest Rubik Pi Image from [Photonvision Github Currently BETA Build](https://github.com/PhotonVision/photonvision/actions/runs/18438258948/artifacts/4246779407)
